				<h3>About Me</h3>
				My name is Tom Williams, I'm studying Computer Science for Games at Sheffield Hallam University, currently in the second year.
				<br><br>
				Ever since playing around with Scratch on a loud, dusty laptop when I was young, I knew game development was my passion. For the time
				being, I'm trying to work on game concepts that excite me in my spare time in addition to my studies at university, but I'd really love
				to pursue game development as a career.
				<br><br>
				The main project I've been working on is the Penguin Game (check it out in my portfolio!), which started as a little experiment with a
				pseudo-3D effect in GameMaker, and has gradually evolved and soon I hope to be able to publish the full game it's becoming! The other
				project I'm actively working on is a simple game engine, made in C++ with DirectX 11, but that was started much more recently so
				unfortunately there isn't a lot to show yet.
