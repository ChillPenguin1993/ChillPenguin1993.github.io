                <h3>Penguin Game</h3>
                <p>This is my ongoing project, it was originally just an experiment gradually it grew into an actual game. It's made with GameMaker Studio
                and is going to be a somewhat relaxed metroidvania. I'm hoping to finish and release it soon, though I've been very busy with
                assignments recently.</p>

                <p class="center">This video shows a bit of the game in lieu of an actual trailer :)<br>

                <p>It originally started from a Super Smash Bros. fangame I was helping to program - I thought the game looked strange, since
                the stage was drawn with an angled perspective while the character sprites had a side-on view more suited to a platformer. Just using
                a 2D side-on sprite for the stage didn't look very interesting, so I had a little experiment with a pseudo-3D effect, using a function
                to draw sprites stretched between 4 vertices. Over time that project died out, so I kept my code to see what I could do with the "2D
                character in 3D environment" aesthetic. Because I'm not using an actual 3D graphics library such as OpenGL (it's just drawing quads),
                it can be quite limiting, but it's fun and challenging to work around the limits and push the effect as far as possible!</p>
