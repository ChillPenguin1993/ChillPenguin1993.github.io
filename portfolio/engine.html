                <h3>DirectX 11 Engine</h3>
                <p>For one of the assignments this year, we were tasked to make a game using C++, starting using SFML and later using DirectX 11 as
                we learn it. You can find more about the SFML part <a href="sfml-shmup.html">here</a>, but for the DirectX part I wanted to attempt
                something a bit more ambitious. I'm not sure how far I want to take this, I couldn't consider it a full engine yet but if I keep
                working on it, maybe it will be!</p>

                <p class="center">Here's the latest video of progress on the engine:<br>

                <p>The main inspiration for this engine comes from Godot, which is often compared to Unity, though there are some differences. Unity
                uses composition, with GameObjects containing components to perform the tasks that GameObject needs to do. Godot tends to focus more
                on inheritance, where everything is a "node" in a big tree, and objects that need to perform specific tasks inherit from node and
                provide extra functionality. Of course, you can still use inheritance in Unity, and likewise composition can be used in Godot by adding
                "components" to a parent object which uses them as necessary (such as a player node with a mesh renderer node, an animator node, and
                collider nodes to check for walls/floors/enemies as children).</p>
