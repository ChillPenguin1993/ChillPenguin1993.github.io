				<h3>SFML Shoot-em-up</h3>
                <p>An ongoing assignment this year is to make a shoot-em-up game using C++. We started this year by learning SFML, a 2D graphics
                library, for simplicity, and we're in the process of learning to use DirectX 11. This is the SFML version of my game, as the DirectX
                version is not ready yet, but this is recent enough to accurately portray my C++ skills.</p>

                <p class="center">This is the most recent progress update, it still features some placeholder assets.

                <p class="center">And the GitHub repository is <a href="https://github.com/ChillPenguin1993/SFML-Shmup">[here!]</a>
                <br>Q shoots bullets, W swings the sword, and Space switches between the ship and the pilot.</p>

                <p>This game uses an "Entity" class as a kind of game actor object, from which other objects (such as the player's ship and bullets)
                are derived, using an overridden update() function. There's a "Scene" class so the game loop in main() only needs to call one function
                to update all entities, for example. Scene contains a list of Entity pointers, so polymorphism can be used, which allows objects
                inheriting from Entity to have different behaviours.</p>
